# Basal-Metabolic-Rate
Calculates your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)


This program calculates the users Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This application was written in C++ and was a project that I was excited to create.
There are many other BMR calculators online, I wanted to create my own to understand how it the calculations work and wanted to 
learn more about C++ when I was first learning the language. Not only that but when I was first learning C++ I was interested in calculation implementations into 
applications and I still am interested.
